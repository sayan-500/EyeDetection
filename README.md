A OpenCV Eye Detection Python project about detecting a human eye with the feature mappers knows as haar cascades.

Here in the project, we will use the python language along with the OpenCV library for the algorithm execution and image processing respectively.

The haar cascades we are going to use in the project are pretrained and stored along with the OpenCV library as haarcascade_eye_default.xml
